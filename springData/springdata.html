	<h1>Spring Data</h1>
	<h2>What is Spring Data for?</h2>
	<p>
		Spring data's mission is to provide a familiar and consistent Spring based programing model for data access, 
		while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before we go any further I think it is very important to get to know the Spring Data homepage: 
		<a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-data/" target="_blank">Spring data homepage</a>
		In this page you will find a lot of examples and documentation.
	</p>
	<p>
		The goal is to convert java object entities into target data source records and persist them, as well as 
		convert the records back to entities.
	</p>

	<h2>Repository Pattern</h2>
	<p>
		The repository pattern is the abstraction used by Spring Data commons 
		for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records by citing entities.
	</p>
	<p>
		Any module for a particular data source has a repository that extends from the generic one. 
		So for example, Spring Data JPA has a JPA repository, Spring Data mongo DB has a mongo repository,
		 Spring Data gemfire has a gemfire repository, and so on.
	</p>

	<h2>Object Relational Mapping (ORM)</h2>
	<p>
		A classic problem in programming is mapping the physical model to the logical model. 
		Typical physical models are relational database, and the logical model is the Java domain objects.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is possible to do ORM in plain vanilla Java, but it's nasty.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Open a transaction</li>
		<li>Query the database which returns the records</li>
		<li>For each record iterate through the fields</li>
		<li>For each field extract the data invoking the proper type conversion</li>
		<li>Map the data to the Java object or object attribute</li>
		<li>Close the transaction</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Queries that modify the database require committing the transaction or rolling it back 
		if an error occurs. Programming this way is tedious. The code is difficult to refactor and maintain.
	</p>

	<p>
		Object to relational mapping frameworks solve this problem. With an ORM framework a developer declares
		metadata to associate Java classes and attributes to database tables and columns. The framework then 
		handles the actual database interactions. So the code is abstracted away from the database. This
		makes it lighter and easier to maintain.
	</p>

	<h2>Java Persistence API (JPA)</h2>
	<p>
		Java persistence application programming interface is an ORM standard, it is not an actual framework.
	</p>
	<p>
		Framework are Hibernate and EclipseLink, as well as Java Enterprise Edition. Those frameworks provide the 
		implementation of the JPA. So even if we speak about a Java application that uses JPA, it is actually 
		using another provider following the JPA specification.
	</p>
	<p>
		The specification includes metadata declarations (XML or annotations) to map Java classes (now called entities) to database tables.
	</p>
	<p>
		An EntityManager creates, reads, updates, and deletes the entities. Changes to the entity's state are reflected 
		back to the database. The entity metadata is in the form of .xml files, or within Java classes, via Java 
		annotations. This tutorial only demonstrates Java annotations. Please refer to the JPA specification if you 
		prefer xml.
	</p>

	<h2>Map a Database table to a Java class</h2>
	<p>Let's see a JPA entity. We'll start with a simple example where we map one database table to one JPA entity.</p>
	<img width="100%" src="./spring_data01.png" alt="mapping-table-jpaentity">

	<p>
		On the left side is an ER diagram component representing a table called student. Student has four columns. 
		Student_id, student_name, student_fulltime, and student_age. On the right side is a Java class called student 
		with four attributes. Student_id of type integer, name, that's a string, fulltime, which is a boolean, and age,
		which is an integer.
	</p>
	<p>
		We have to use the followings annotations to do the mapping:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The class must be annotated with @Entity</li>
		<li>@Table is where we specify the database table name</li>
		<li>Entities must have a unique identifier attribute with @Id. If desired, @Generatedvalue tells JPA to 
			generate the id when persisted. For this reason, we don't include student id in the constructor</li>
		<li>@Column maps the class attributes to table columns</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Now that we have mapped the java class with the database table, all of our coding can stay in the logical 
		world because JPA will take care of the physical world for us.
	</p>

	<h2>Map multiple tables to java classes</h2>
	<p>
		Now let's look at an ER diagram with multiple tables. There are four tables in our University database. 
		Department, course, enrollment and student. Department is the academic division of a university and has
		 an ID and a name. Course is a particular class offered at the university. It also has an ID and a name as well 
		 as an ID of its department. Students are enrolled in courses, so we have a join table called enrollment that 
		 has a course ID and a student ID.
	</p>
	<img width="100%" src="./spring_data02.png" alt="mapping-multiple-table-jpaentity">

	<p>Now let's see how to map the updated physical model to our logical model. There is a relationship many to one
		 between department and course. So, how do we map this relationship? The Course has a "course_dept_id" so we 
		 need an attribute anotated with @JoinColum and @ManyToOne. The @ManyToOne annotation shows cardinality (many 
		 courses are mapped to one department). 
	</p>
	<img width="100%" src="./spring_data03.png" alt="one-to-many-relationship">
	<p>
		Now let's look at the other side of the relationship. Department to courses, the department has a list of courses
		so we need an attribute List&ltCourse&gt courses. And we have to annotate this attirubte with @OneToMany. 
		The parameters passed to @OneToMany express the following:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>mappedBy="department" The mapped by equals department parameter refers to the department attribute back 
			in the course class.
			<img width="100%" src="./spring_data04.png" alt="mappedBy">
		</li>
		<li>fetch = FetchType.EAGER By default, one to many attributes are not automatically fetched from the database. 
			This is called lazy loading, but we can override that with the fetchtype.eager setting. So when a department 
			is read from the database, JPA also populates the associated courses</li>
		<li>cascade = CascadeType.ALL The cascade parameter controls the state of the collection attributes for an entity. 
			With cascade set to all, any state changes that are made in the department should apply to its courses as well.
		</li>
	</ul>
