	<h1>Spring Data</h1>
	<h2>What is Spring Data for?</h2>
	<p>
		Spring data's mission is to provide a familiar and consistent Spring based programing model for data access, 
		while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before we go any further I think it is very important to get to know the Spring Data homepage: 
		<a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-data/" target="_blank">Spring data homepage</a>
		In this page you will find a lot of examples and documentation.
	</p>
	<p>
		The goal is to convert java object entities into target data source records and persist them, as well as 
		convert the records back to entities.
	</p>

	<h2>Repository Pattern</h2>
	<p>
		The repository pattern is the abstraction used by Spring Data commons 
		for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records by citing entities.
	</p>
	<p>
		Any module for a particular data source has a repository that extends from the generic one. 
		So for example, Spring Data JPA has a JPA repository, Spring Data mongo DB has a mongo repository,
		 Spring Data gemfire has a gemfire repository, and so on.
	</p>

	<h2>Object Relational Mapping (ORM)</h2>
	<p>
		A classic problem in programming is mapping the physical model to the logical model. 
		Typical physical models are relational database, and the logical model is the Java domain objects.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is possible to do ORM in plain vanilla Java, but it's nasty.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Open a transaction</li>
		<li>Query the database which returns the records</li>
		<li>For each record iterate through the fields</li>
		<li>For each field extract the data invoking the proper type conversion</li>
		<li>Map the data to the Java object or object attribute</li>
		<li>Close the transaction</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Queries that modify the database require committing the transaction or rolling it back 
		if an error occurs. Programming this way is tedious. The code is difficult to refactor and maintain.
	</p>

	<p>
		Object to relational mapping frameworks solve this problem. With an ORM framework a developer declares
		metadata to associate Java classes and attributes to database tables and columns. The framework then 
		handles the actual database interactions. So the code is abstracted away from the database. This
		makes it lighter and easier to maintain.
	</p>

	<h2>Java Persistence API (JPA)</h2>
	<p>
		Java persistence application programming interface is an ORM standard, it is not an actual framework.
	</p>
	<p>
		Framework are Hibernate and EclipseLink, as well as Java Enterprise Edition. Those frameworks provide the 
		implementation of the JPA. So even if we speak about a Java application that uses JPA, it is actually 
		using another provider following the JPA specification.
	</p>
	<p>
		The specification includes metadata declarations (XML or annotations) to map Java classes (now called entities) to database tables.
	</p>
	<p>
		An EntityManager creates, reads, updates, and deletes the entities. Changes to the entity's state are reflected 
		back to the database. The entity metadata is in the form of .xml files, or within Java classes, via Java 
		annotations. This tutorial only demonstrates Java annotations. Please refer to the JPA specification if you 
		prefer xml.
	</p>
