//  The console log uses the standard output object to actually log messages to the console.
//  It logs the message and also controls the line spacing of a message to give you a new line. 
//  process.stdout is our standard output object and we can use the write method to write some strings 
//  to the Terminal. 
process.stdout.write("Hello this is a message using the standard output");
