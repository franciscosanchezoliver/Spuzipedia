	<h1>Scrum</h1>
	<h2>Intro</h2>
	<p>
		In this document I will talk about the basics of scrum framework. I'll cover how scrum organizes work and teams
		to deliver usable product and get feedback quickly. Finally I'll talk about how to measure and manage your work
		continuosly while helping the team improving their processes along the way.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are starting up, just focus on getting a daily stand up going (because it's only a 15 minutes commitment
		each day and you'll see immediate results with your team).
	</p>
	<h2>The scrum approach to project success</h2>
	<p>
		On a project team the goal is to get the project done. Historically, using traditional methods this meant planning
		and designing the whole project at the beginning and sticking to that with no variations. But in a real life
		project, work is completely unpredictable. It's imposible to know at the beginning exactly how a project will 
		unfold.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <question>Agile project management</question> movement comes out of a desire to <question>adapt in real time</question> to 
		the <question>changing circumstances</question> that teams face.
	</p>
	<p>
		We have to change the focus from winning the whole game to win each and every milestone and deliverable.
