    <h1>Azure Databricks</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Apache Spark-based</li>
        <li>Analytics platform</li>
        <li>Azure cloud</li>
        <li>Enables colaboration between data scientists, data engineers, and business analysts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Apache Spark Ecosystem</h2>
    <p>Since it is based on apache Spark the key features you will get from this are:
        <ul>
            <li>Spark SQL + Dataframes</li>
            <li>Streaming</li>
            <li>Machine Learning Library</li>
            <li>GraphX</li>
        </ul>
        Everything is based on Spark core API, which means you can use R, 
        you can use SparkSQL, Python, Scala and Java.
    </p>
    <p>
        Databricks as a platform has a lot of features itself, besides 
        being Apache Spark based it is also a workspace where you can
        colaborate with your friends and colleagues on your scripts. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have multiple scripts, you can combine them into workflows.
        Worksflows can be nestings of the scripts. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Also you have a DB i/o which is Databricks input/ouput library
        allowing you to connect multiple services both in Azure, 
        Apache Kafka, Apache Hadoop, but also databricks has something
        called Databricks Serverless. What this really means is that 
        when you work with Databricks you just specify what kind of
        server do you want. How powerfull it is, how many of those 
        servers do you want, what is the runtime that you want on it.
    </p>
